# PyProjects
Python projects from The Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 50 Days with 20 Apps on Udemy

## Motivation
The motivation I had for putting this repo up was to have an example of the work that I have completed in this course
and to have a reference to the packages used in this video for both me and anybody else who may be interested.

## Content
In this repo you will find a handful of small-scale projects that use the basics of python as well as some
important packages that are used frequently.
